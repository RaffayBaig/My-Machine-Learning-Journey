# 🌳 Decision Tree Classifier with Cost-Complexity Pruning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to build, train, and optimize a **Decision Tree Classifier** using **Cost-Complexity Pruning (CCP)**.  
The goal is to show how pruning helps balance model complexity and accuracy, reducing overfitting.

---

## ⚙️ Features
- Data preprocessing using **scikit-learn Pipelines**
- Training a **Decision Tree Classifier**
- Visualizing the **Cost-Complexity Pruning Path**
- Automatically selecting the **best ccp_alpha**
- Plotting the **final pruned decision tree**
- Evaluation with accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **scikit-learn**
- **Matplotlib**
- **NumPy / Pandas**

---

## 📊 Results
- Compared training vs test accuracy for different pruning levels  
- Identified the best `ccp_alpha` that improves generalization  
- Visualized the final simplified decision tree
